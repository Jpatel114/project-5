/**
* Function: sq_give_buzzer()
* Description:  This is the "enqueue" operation.  For us
*    a "buzzer" is represented by an integer (starting
*    from zero).  The function selects an available buzzer 
*    and places a new entry at the end of the service queue 
*    with the selected buzer-ID. 
*    This buzzer ID is returned.
*    The assigned buzzer-ID is a non-negative integer 
*    with the following properties:
*
*       (1) the buzzer (really it's ID) is not currently 
*         taken -- i.e., not in the queue.  (It
*         may have been in the queue at some previous
*         time -- i.e., buzzer can be re-used).
*	  This makes sense:  you can't give the same
*	  buzzer to two people!
*
*       (2) If there are buzzers that can be re-used, one
*         of those buzzers is used.  A re-usable buzzer is 
*	  a buzzer that _was_ in the queue at some previous
*	  time, but currently is not.
*
*       (3) if there are no previously-used buzzers, the smallest 
*         possible buzzer-ID is used (retrieved from inventory).  
*	  Properties in this situation (where N is the current
*	  queue length):
*
*		- The largest buzzer-ID used so far is N-1
*
*		- All buzzer-IDs in {0..N-1} are in the queue
*			(in some order).
*
*		- The next buzzer-ID (from the basement) is N.
*
*    In other words, you can always get more buzzers (from
*    the basement or something), but you don't fetch an
*    additional buzzer unless you have to.
*    you don't order new buzzers 
*
* Comments/Reminders:
*
*	Rule (3) implies that when we start from an empty queue,
*	the first buzzer-ID will be 0 (zero).
*
*	Rule (2) does NOT require that the _minimum_ reuseable 
*	buzzer-ID be used.  If there are multiple reuseable buzzers, 
*	any one of them will do.
*	
*	Note the following property:  if there are no re-useable 
*	buzzers, the queue contains all buzzers in {0..N-1} where
*       N is the current queue length (of course, the buzzer IDs 
*	may be in any order.)
*
* RUNTIME REQUIREMENT:  O(1)  ON AVERAGE or "AMORTIZED"  
		In other words, if there have been M calls to 
*		sq_give_buzzer, the total time taken for those 
*		M calls is O(M).
*
*		An individual call may therefore not be O(1) so long
*		as when taken as a whole they average constant time.
*
*		(Hopefully this reminds you of an idea we employed in
*		the array-based implementation of the stack ADT).
